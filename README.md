# Airbnb Clone
The site we are cloning is https://news.airbnb.com/ using Bootstrap 4. It is a very standard Bootstrapesque design.

## Expectations
Expect you to work to the best of your ability and effort to create a clone of the news page of Airbnb. It should satisfy the following:
- Reference the live version on https://news.airbnb.com/.
- Has a navigation bar, main content, and footer.
- Be mobile responsive.
- Has similar layout as the original website.
- Use free images sourced from the internet.
- Has a drop down navigation menu for mobile screens using Bootstrap's drop down system.
- You can attempt the language drop down menu in the navigation bar.
- You only need to clone the first three rows of articles. Further rows are just repeated layout and you don't need to clone them.

Do not need to clone interactive behaviours, such as navbar slide out effect. Or the carousell. These require more advanced coding in JavaScript.
